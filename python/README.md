Objects are passed by reference:
When you pass an object to a function, you're actually passing a reference to that object. This means that the function can modify the object itself.
Immutable objects behave like pass by value:
If you pass an immutable object (like a string, integer, or tuple) to a function, any changes made to the object within the function won't affect the original object outside the function. This is because modifications to immutable objects create new objects.
