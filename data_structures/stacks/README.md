# Stacks

## Description

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It operates similarly to a stack of plates: you add plates to the top, and when you need one, you take the top plate first.

A stack typically supports two main operations:

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the element from the top of the stack.

Additional operations may include:

- Peek/Top: View the element at the top without removing it.
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

Stacks are commonly used in scenarios like function calls, expression evaluation, and undo operations in applications.

## Shell Code

```python
class Solution:
    def stack():
        stack = []
        stack.append(element)
        stack.pop()
```
